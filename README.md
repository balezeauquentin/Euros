## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals

The main objective of this project is to deepen my understanding of **PyTorch** and **Transformers**:
- Learn how they work and how they are implemented in Large Language Models (LLMs).
- Explore their usage in real-world applications.
- Build my own **French-speaking LLM** to serve as a assistant running locally on my **Arch Linux system**.
