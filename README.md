## Introduction

**Project-Euros** aims to leverage LoRa (Long Range) technology to develop a highly intelligent AI system. LoRa is a wireless communication technology designed for long-range, low-power communications, making it ideal for IoT and AI applications that require vast network coverage with minimal power consumption.

## Features

- **Long Range Communication**: Utilize LoRa technology to enable AI communication over long distances.
- **Low Power Consumption**: Optimize power usage to ensure sustainability and longevity of devices.
- **Advanced AI Algorithms**: Implement state-of-the-art AI algorithms for intelligent decision-making and data processing.
- **Scalability**: Designed to scale from small deployments to large networks.
- **Open Source**: Fully open-source project encouraging collaboration and innovation.
